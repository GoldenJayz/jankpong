# jankpong

Jank pong is a game I scripted using Unity and C#

The game is just a normal half assed pong game that is fun due to it's jank bugs that I like to call mechanics.

# Glitches
There is none cause they're all <em>mechanics!</em>
All these <em>mechanics</em> were totally intentional.
I am too lazy to fix these <em>mechanics</em>
